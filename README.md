# 🔐 Secure Data Embed System – Demo

This is a **web-based demo project** that demonstrates **data security concepts** such as **encryption, CRC, compression, and steganography** (data hiding in images).  
The app is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and runs completely in the browser (no backend required).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 Upload and process input files (text, images, documents, etc.)  
- 🔑 Simple **XOR encryption/decryption** (demo only, not secure for real use)  
- 🔄 **CRC32 checksum** generation for integrity verification  
- 📉 **Compression simulation** (removes vowels from text)  
- 📈 **Decompression demo** (echoes compressed data)  
- 🖼️ **Steganography**: Embed data into an image (via LSB technique – demo simplified)  
- 📤 **De-embed data** from the modified image  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – interface layout  
- **CSS3** – styling  
- **JavaScript** – logic (file handling, encryption, CRC, compression, embedding)  
- **Canvas API** – used for image processing & steganography demo

## 📖 How to Run
1. Clone/download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-data-embed-demo.git
   cd secure-data-embed-demo
````

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Upload a **data file** and optionally an **image file**.
4. Use the provided buttons to encrypt, decrypt, compress, generate CRC, embed, and de-embed data.

---

## 📸 Demo Workflow

1. Upload a text file
2. Click **Encrypt** → data is XOR encrypted
3. Click **Decrypt** → restores original text
4. Click **Generate CRC** → shows file checksum
5. Click **Compress** → removes vowels
6. Upload an image and click **Embed Data** → stores data length in image pixels
7. Click **De-Embed Data** → retrieves stored length and previews extracted content

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* The XOR cipher is for **demo purposes only** (not secure).
* Compression is a **simulation** (removing vowels).
* Steganography is simplified (stores only data length, not full payload).
* Works best with **text files** and small demo images.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Replace XOR with AES or RSA encryption
* Implement real compression (e.g., Huffman coding)
* Expand steganography to embed **full data in pixel LSBs**
* Add drag-and-drop support for files

👉 Do you want me to also **add screenshots preview section** (with placeholders) in the README, so you can later replace them with actual images?
